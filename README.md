# nested-todos

Your job is to create a todo list where every todo can have its own "nested" todos. To illustrate the concept, below is a normal todo that does NOT have any nested todos.

Me so normal, average, boring.
Here's a todo that has a single nested todo.

I have...
a nested todo!
This can go on forever. Any todo can have ANY number of nested todos. Your job is to enable this behavior. Of course, you should still be able to add todos, delete todos, edit todos, and mark todos complete. If you'd like inspiration, see Workflowy.
